# Hack Notes

This repository contains my personal notes for understanding many vulnerabilities
across various domains in information security.

It is a living record and personal encyclopedia of how to hack the planet.

The best way to interact with this repository is using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
However, the main points should be (more-or-less) organized into bite-sized chunks
in labelled Markdown files.
