# Hack Notes

This repository contains my personal notes for understanding many vulnerabilities
across various domains in information security.

It is a living record and personal encyclopedia of how to hack the planet.

## Viewing the files

`reference/` contains all of the Markdown files containing hacking info.

The best way to interact with this repository is using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
That's how I'm writing and viewing the files currently and the notes themselves use
[[backlinks]] where relevant in order to create relationships between the notes.

It's possible that a similar alternative like Zettlr or Notion could work if those
things use backlinks the same way.
