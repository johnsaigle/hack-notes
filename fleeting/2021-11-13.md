STOK bind DNS issue for OOB testing. new thing to learn, could open up a new vulnerability class to work with

Burp (Pro) Ex: finds sensitive info in JS. Maybe a replacement for extractmap + trufflehog? Worth checking out when I buy Burp Pro

Pentesters using commonspeak to generate custom wordlists. Should give a better understanding on how to actually use this to find bounties.

UploadScanner Burp extension. Appears to try multiple file extensions and content-types etc for attacking uploads in an automated way.

Example XXE payloads for various platforms. Talks about "local DTD files". Technique to deal with firewalls that block loading external DTD resources from a domain you control

Defcon talk on scraping whole cloud ranges for certs that match a target. Related blog post. Could allow to detect dev servers quickly before they're public and filter through to other sources.

Port swigger information on obfuscation. Could be really helpful for dealing with various WAFs and in particular understanding how to better make use of HTML encoding, Unicode encoding, and other related encoding that I don't really know how to use well

Axiom distributed cloud scanning platform. Allows to push commands to a fleet of small VMs in order to speed up scans and avoid rate-limiting issues. Could drastically reduce time spent scanning. Contains many submodules of useful tools that could be very helpful; using axiom would be faster than downloading and configuring them all individually.

BBRF, Bug Bounty reconnaisance framework. Keeps track of things like in scope hosts in a centralized DB. Can feed multiple tools to it. Auto filters for scope, so e.g. you can set up your own scope and then cat the output of tools into it. It will automatically filter the ones that are not in scope

CI/CD from a Bug Bounty perspective. Person tangentially related to dependency confusion bugs. Could be useful for extending knowledge on that topic and getting into more niche bug classes to exploit.

Recon++ Burp extension. Helps for in-app reconnaissance -- DNS requests, API calls etc.

Kiterunner. Claims to be a smarter version of something like ffuf, specifically for scanning APIs and modern webapps. E.g. it can help to find endpoints that will only respond when given a specific method/header/param/value

Taborator. Burp plug-in. Puts Collaborator into its own tab and notifies you of new connections


Bug Bounty + machine learning. Could be an interesting/different approach to go about bount.y Could also improve my python skills and set me up to teach at Concordia
